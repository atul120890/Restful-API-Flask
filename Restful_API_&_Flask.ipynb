        "\n",
        "Ans-Flask is a lightweight, open-source Python web framework that's widely used for building web applications and RESTful APIs. It's popular because it's simple, flexible, and easy to get started with, especially for small to medium-sized projects.'''\n",

It provides a set of tools and utilities that make it easier to work with databases in Flask, abstracting many of the complexities involved in database interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the main roles and features of Flask-SQLAlchemy:\n",
        "\n",
        "Database Integration: It connects Flask with a database (usually SQL-based, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL) by providing an ORM layer to map Python objects to database tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplified Database Setup: Flask-SQLAlchemy helps you configure the connection between Flask and the database, often just requiring a database URI to set up the connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Using SQLAlchemy’s ORM, Flask-SQLAlchemy allows you to interact with the database in terms of Python objects. You can define your database schema in Python classes, which SQLAlchemy automatically maps to tables in your database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Session Management: Flask-SQLAlchemy handles the creation and management of sessions, making it easier to query and manipulate data in a transactional context.\n",

        "\n",
        "Flask blueprints are a way to organize and structure your Flask application by breaking it into modular components. They allow you to define routes, views, static files, templates, and other functionality in separate, reusable modules, making it easier to manage complex applications\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits of Using Flask Blueprints:\n",
        "Better Organization: Blueprints allow you to split up your app into logical sections (e.g., user-related views, product-related views), making the codebase more organized and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: If you have a common feature (like user authentication) that you want to use in multiple projects, you can create a blueprint for it and simply reuse it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ease of Testing: Modular blueprints can make testing easier since you can test each blueprint in isolation rather than having to test the entire application at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clear Separation: They provide a clear separation of different parts of your application, reducing complexity as your application grows'''\n",

        "Key Attributes and Methods of the request Object:\n",
        "request.method: The HTTP method of the request (e.g., 'GET', 'POST').\n",

        "\n",
        "ans-Flask's jsonify() function is used to create a JSON response from Python data structures (such as dictionaries, lists, etc.). It converts the Python objects into JSON format and sets the appropriate Content-Type header (application/json), making it easier to return JSON responses from your Flask routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Purposes of jsonify():\n",
        "Convert Python Objects to JSON:\n",

        "Set the Correct Content-Type:\n",
        "When Flask returns a JSON response, it automatically sets the Content-Type header to application/json, signaling that the response body is in JSON format. This is done automatically by jsonify().\n",

        "\n",
        "In Flask, static files (such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and other files that do not change dynamically) are handled by the static folder. Flask automatically serves files placed in this folder and provides a convenient way to link to them in your HTML templates.\n",

        "How Flask Handles Static Files:\n",
        "Static Folder:\n",
        "By default, Flask looks for static files in a folder named static at the root level of your application directory. When you start the Flask application, Flask serves static files from this folder at the URL path /static/.\n",
